<a name="1.1"><b>[1.1] - What is Hostile Intent?</b></a><br><dir>
Well, here are some basics: Hostile Intent is a First Person Shooter (FPS). It is a Total Conversion Modification for the Half-Life 1 engine. It is a computer game.
<p>
I will take a cue from our website and give you this brief blurb describing what the concept behind Hostile Intent is:

<blockquote>
<i>Hostile Intent for all intents and purposes is the thinking man's First Person Shooter. In Hostile Intent the player has to use cover wisely, conserve his ammo, work well with his teammates, use communication effectively, keep the mission at the forefront of his mind and especially keep his cool under fire.
<p>
Those of you who have not played Hostile Intent before are in for a bit of a shock. Hostile Intent, all teams being of equal skill levels, is a very hard game. A very hard game for most players initially. It takes a few times to get the hang of the game mechanics and you have to observe other players and how they act and react but you will pick it up. Everyone does.
<p>
The basic concept comes from how we have played in the Tom Clancy Rainbow Six series of games but we have a smattering of Ghost Recon too. You, the player, have to take the mission slow, steady and careful in order to complete it and stay alive. Clancy’s games have become very popular in the commercial market and they filled a much-needed niche. The same goes for Hostile Intent. We are the only team based tactical shooter in the Half Life community that takes “realism”, real tactics, believable scenarios, and honestly takes them seriously enough to bring to you, the player.</i>
</blockquote>

So now you want to know how to play? Read on...

<a name="2.1"><b>[2.1] - How do I install Hostile Intent?</b></a><br><dir>
Chances are, if you're reading this you've already downloaded Hostile Intent. If not, though, you need to go to our <a href="http://www.hostileintent.org/site/downloads/" target="new"><b>downloads page</b></a> to get it. Grab the latest <b>full</b> Windows version (<b>not</b> the update) in order to play.
<p>
In order to play Hostile Intent, you must have <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/" target="new"><b>Steam</b></a>. Steam is Valve's broadband content delivery service, you need it to play any games made by Valve. Valve is the company that made Half-Life. Since Hostile Intent is a Half-Life modification, you need Steam. <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/index.php?area=getsteamnow" target="new">Go download it.</a>
<br><br>
<a name="2.1.1"><b>[2.1.1] - How do I install Steam?</b></a><dir>
Installing Steam is a whole process on its own that is far beyond the scope of this manual. There's a great tutorial <a href="http://home.covad.net/~k25125/SteamyThings/Steam_Install_FAQ.htm" target="new">right here</a> about how to install Steam. If you still have further questions, use the <a href="http://steampowered.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/steampowered.cfg/php/enduser/std_alp.php?p_sid=cygwBzBh" target="new">Steam Support System</a> or visit the <a href="http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/" target="new">Steam Forums</a>.
</dir>
</dir>
<br>
<a name="2.2"><b>[2.2] - Okay, I installed Steam and downloaded Hostile Intent. Now how do I install Hostile Intent?</b></a><br><dir>
Open up the installer. You will see a screen similar to this:
<br><br>
<img src="manual/installer_01.jpg" border="0">
<br><br>
Click "Next". You will now see this screen:
<br><br>
<img src="manual/installer_02.jpg" border="0">
<br><br>
The installer automatically finds the Steam directory where your Half-Life mod files should go (basically, where the Hostile Intent files should go). Double check that the installer is pointing to your \Steam\SteamApps\email@address.com\half-life directory. That is where the installer will create your \hostileintent directory.
<br><br>
Click "Install" and allow the installer to do its work. When it has completed, click "Finish" and move on to the next step.

<br>

<a name="2.3"><b>[2.3] - How do I run the game?</b></a><br><dir>
Open up Steam and click on "Play Games". You should see "Hostile Intent" listed under "Third Party Games", like this:
<br><br>
<img src="manual/steam_01.jpg" border="0">
<br><br>
Double-click on Hostile Intent.

</dir>
<br>
<a name="2.4"><b>[2.4] - How do I configure my video, sound, and control settings?</b></a><br><dir>
From the main Hostile Intent menu, click on "Options". You will see various tabs for Keyboard, Mouse, Audio, Video, etc. Customize your player controls in the "Keyboard" tab, and adjust any other settings in the other tabs. Here is an example of what the Options window may look like under the Keyboard tab:
<br><br>
<img src="manual/controls_01.jpg" border="0">
<br><br>
As you can see, I've made a few adjustments to the default controls. Over time you may also make adjustments to fit your style. If you wish to get into some more advanced customized control configurations, including aliases and scripts, see <a href="http://thr.hostileintent.org/guide/script/scripting.php" target="new">this tutorial at The Hostile Report</a>.

<a name="3.1"><b>[3.1] - How do I play Hostile Intent?</b></a><br><dir>
This is a very broad question which can be more effectively answered if it is divided up into two questions. Hostile Intent is a team-oriented, objective-based first person shooter. That means you need to know how to do two things: <b>find the objectives</b> and <b>shoot people</b>. In any given mission there are one or more objectives to accomplish and plenty of bad guys to kill along the way. The objectives change from map to map, and the enemy always looks different, so you have to grow accustomed to a great number of scenarios. It takes time, but you'll get there.
<br><br>
<a name="3.1.1"><b>[3.1.1] - How do I shoot my gun?</b></a><br><dir>
You have to raise your iron sights in order to shoot in Hostile Intent. The default command is <b>right-click</b> (mouse2). Ta-da. Fire away.
</dir>
<br>
<a name="3.1.2"><b>[3.1.2] - What is the objective? How do I find the objective?</b></a><br><dir>
Different maps have different objectives in different amounts. The objectives are usually centered around gathering intelligence documents, defusing explosives, etc. For a full listing of objectives from all official Hostile Intent maps, check out the <a href="manual/maps.html">Hostile Intent Map Objectives</a> included in this manual.
<br><br>
When you encounter an objective, go up to it and press <b>Use</b> (default is E). Here is an example of an objective being used:
<br><br>
<img src="manual/objective_01.jpg" border="0">
</dir>
</dir>
<br>
<a name="3.2"><b>[3.2] - How do I know how much ammo/health I have left?</b></a><br><dir>
You don't. It doesn't take all that many hits to die in Hostile Intent, so play as if death was around every corner. Count your shots, too, and reload when you think your magazine is getting close to dry. Rarely will you run out of ammo in HI, but if you often do, select "Extra Ammo" in one of your equipment slots in the VGUI (see section 3.3).
</dir><br>
<a name="3.3"><b>[3.3] - How do I change weapons and teams?</b></a><br><dir>
When you first connect to a server, you will be brought to the team selection menu. At any time during the game you can change teams by pressing [ (left bracket). The team selection menu looks like this:
<br><br>
<img src="manual/vgui_02.jpg" border="0">
<br><br>
As you can see, this is also the mission briefing screen. Read over the mission briefing to learn about the scenario and the objectives. Or just skip it and choose a team. You can choose Nato or Tango, or click Auto and have the server choose for you.
<br><br>
Once you've chosen a team, you are brought to the weapon selection menu. This menu can also be accessed at any time by pressing ] (right bracket). The weapon selection menu looks like this:
<br><br>
<img src="manual/vgui_01.jpg" border="0">
<br><br>
As you can see, this is the Nato weapon selection screen. The Tango screen looks similar, but with different colours. Choose your weapon loadout from the dropdown menus, then click on the arrow at the bottom right to proceed to the game.
</dir>
<br>
<a name="3.4"><b>[3.4] - How do I use voice communication?</b></a><br><dir>
In the keyboard configuration tab within the Options menu (see section 2.4 in this manual) you will see the option to bind a key to Voice communication. Once you have something bound to that key, just press it and talk away in-game to communicate with your teammates.
</dir>
<br>
<a name="3.5"><b>[3.5] - How do I report in?</b></a><br><dir>
The default "Reporting In" key is V. It is not possible to change this in the keyboard configuration menu, but you can adjust it manually by typing <i>bind {key} "say_team Reporting In"</i> in the console (which is accessible by pressing the tilde [~] key). Replace "{key}" with the desired key, for example: <i>bind V "say_team Reporting In"</i>

As you probably read in the introduction, Hostile Intent is not an easy game to learn. It takes a great deal of practice and patience to learn the nuances of the various maps, different weapons, and different situations. There are three basic tips you should know before starting though:
<br><br>
<dir>
<b>Know Thy Map.</b> Know the different ways in and out of an objective room or area. Know where you're going to be attacked from. This comes in time with practice, but it's helpful to run around a map on your own to learn the basics first. Extend your knowledge to include where the best shadows are to hide in, and what foliage gives the best camouflage on the jungle maps.
<br><br>
<b>Know Thy Weapon.</b> Know which weapon suits which scenario. Don't take a shotgun into a wide open landscape. Don't take an M16 into a submarine. HI has a built in zoom effect when you raise your sights to simulate the limits of your peripheral vision. It also helps to aim at those targets that are a little farther away. Sniper rifles zoom in the farthest, assault rifles second, sub-machine guns third, shotguns fourth, and pistols don't zoom in at all. Bring the weapon that will work best in the map.
<br><br>
<b>Know Thy Equipment.</b> Frag grenades can fill a room with death and destruction. Flashbangs are nice because you can carry two in one slot, but they can be very ineffective against an opponent who has taken cover. Smoke grenades help you make safe passage across dangerous fire zones. Equip yourself with what will help you on your mission, for it can make all the difference in the world to you and your team. Don't forget your nightvision on those dark maps!
<br><br>
</dir>
</dir>
<a name="4.2"><b>[4.2] - How do I breach a room?</b></a><br><dir>
There are a great many tactics that you can employ in HI to move effectively through a map. You must remember these three words: Cut the pie, cut the pie, cut the pie! If this means nothing to you, you must read the <a href="http://tcr.hostileintent.org/tactical.html" target="new">Combat Basics Manual</a>. Scroll down to the "Technique" section and learn all about cutting the pie. While you're there, read the rest of the page too!
</dir>
<br>
<a name="4.3"><b>[4.3] - How do I use frag grenades, flashbangs, and smoke grenades effectively?</b></a><br><dir>
It's one thing to have the right equipment, it's another to know how to use it. To put it simply, throw grenades and flashbangs at the enemy. Use your smoke grenades so the enemy can't see you. Is it that simple? Well no, but it's a start. Read on:
<br><br>
<dir>
<b>Frag grenades:</b> Stick a frag grenade into a room with four opposing team members and boom, you're the hero. Sometimes it's tricky to land your grenade in the right spot to frag your opponent, but with practice you can learn to bank those nades off the right walls at the right angles and stick that puppy right at your enemy's feet. When you feel really confident you can practice cooking your nades (hold down primary fire but don't let go right away) in order to have them explode at the right times. Grenades have a 4.5 second fuse so don't hold on too long! And remember: a grenade unused is a grenade wasted, so frag out!
<br><br>
<b>Flashbangs:</b> Flashbangs are a trickier bunch because you very often have to land them within direct line of sight of your opponent for them to be at all effective. However, because you get two of them in one inventory slot, you have the chance to throw at multiple angles. You cannot cook a flashbang but you should know that the fuse is 2 seconds, so take cover quickly! If you've successfully flashed your opponent, they will be blinded for several seconds, allowing you to storm in and kill them swiftly and easily.
<br><br>
<b>Smoke grenades:</b> If you feel like anytime you step out from behind cover you get wasted by an enemy waiting there just for you, you need smokers. Throw that smoke and let the cloud of white fill the surrounding area, allowing you safe passage. Or if you know an enemy is camping out in that small room around the corner, smoke him out so that his visibility is compromised.
