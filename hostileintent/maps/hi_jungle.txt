// MISSION

Time:           1324 ZULU
Location:       Rain forest, Peru

// SITUATION

In connection with similar raids in Central
America, the goal of this mission is to
gather intel from a drug manufacturing plant
deep in the Peruvian rain forest. Intel needs
to be gathered to ensure that a raid at a
large warehouse of the Peruvian drug lord
Carlos Quiñones can be carried out with
legitimate reason.

// BACKGROUND

Local narcotics detectives are probing what
seems to be an expansion of drugs, arms and
alien-smuggling between Colombia and Peru,
its neighbor to the south-west. Drug agents
say that planes and trucks loaded with
cocaine leave regularly for Colombia from
the rain forests of Peru. Within the
framework of this increased drug smuggling,
the international community has decided to
fight several Central American drug cartels
by executing various top secret operations
in the South American jungles.
