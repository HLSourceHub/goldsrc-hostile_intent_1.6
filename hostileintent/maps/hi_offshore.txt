During a routine crew exchange, a transport tug

that the hijackers brought two cases aboard.

carried onto the platform are low-yield nuclear
devices. Intelligence also reports that the
platform is being used for an illegal weapons
auction.

// BACKGROUND

The Russian Mafia is a group of the most
powerful gangsters in the world, owning the
majority of Russian banks and holding the ability
to get weapons from the Russian Army. Some Mafia
groups even own their own weapon factories. The
Russians have spread out since the fall of the
Soviet Union and have established strongholds in
Western and Eastern Europe, the United States,
Canada, the Middle East (particularly Israel) and
have established links with South American drug
cartels. They have business in weapons, drugs,
prostitution, money laundering, and anything that
makes a dollar - even selling nuclear submarines
to Colombian drug cartels.
