// MISSION

Time:           0530 ZULU
Location:       Sydney, Australia

// SITUATION

At 0130, well-known author David Byrne's house
was raided. David and his family were taken
hostage, and bombs were placed in multiple
locations. The house is being patrolled by a
highly armed and highly dangerous group of
terrorists.

// BACKGROUND

The terrorist group is of Indonesian origin and
has been secretly training in the Australian
outback. They have targeted author David Byrne
as his books focus on the life, and ultimate
capture, of their beloved fanatical leader
Sheikh Samanhudi. Attempts at negotiations have
been unsuccessful - the terrorists demand
money, the release of their imprisoned leader,
and safe passage to a foreign country of their
designation.
