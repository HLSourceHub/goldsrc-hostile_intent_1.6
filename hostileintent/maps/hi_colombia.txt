// MISSION

Time:           1725 ZULU
Location:       Colombia, near the city of
                    Budaramanga
// SITUATION

A cartel operating out of the hills near the
city of Budaramanga has been trafficking drugs
into the U.S. for over nine months, with an
alarming rate of success. Recent circumstantial
evidence has come to light implicating a coast
guard official in the southwest. Large sums of
money have been deposited into his bank account
at regular intervals.

// BACKGROUND

Satellites intercepted a phone call the official
made to the cartel's outpost. It is believed this
outpost contains substantial information about
local crops, as well as evidence of
correspondence between the official and the
cartel and his alleged payoffs. Securing these
documents will strike a vital blow to the heart
of the cartel.
