// MISSION

Time:          0930 ZULU
Location:      Northeast Spain

// BACKGROUND

The Basque region of northeastern Spain and
southern France are suffering from one of the
longest and most violent terrorist style actions
in the world.  A terrorist group known as the
Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA, translates to Basque
Country and Liberty) formed in 1959 has been
responsible for most of the violence. They are
dedicated to seeing the Basque region of Spain
and France become a sovereign state.  ETA has
killed approximately 800 people in their
struggle for independence. Though the Basque
region is in Spain and France most of the
violence has been in Spain.

// SITUATION

(NATO)
Members of the ETA have assaulted the estate of
a prominent Spanish government official late last
night.  It appears as if the ETA has acted on poor
intelligence and has trapped themselves on the
estate.  They have confirmed that they are holding
two hostages, the official and his wife, luckily
his children where away visiting friends. ETA's
exact location cannot be determined at this time;
it is believed that they are located in the house.

The estate contains a large house located
approximately in the center of a valley.  A
boathouse which usually houses a 82' yacht is
located behind and slightly below the house. Two
different approaches are possible, one from the
inlet via the boathouse and one from a remote
corner atop a small plateau via helicopter. A
helicopter has been flying over the area for a few
hours now; a helicopter insertion will not
eliminate the possibility of a surprise attack. The
terrain of the estate is very hilly.  It would be
advisable to stay in the valleys so the element of
surprise will not be lost.

The weather, while not optimal, may work for us.
Winds are very strong, gusting to 55 km/h at times.
The noise generated from the wind will help to
cover up any noise generated from the approach.
Other than the wind, conditions are good; it looks
to be a clear sunny day.

The Spanish government wishes the assault to take
place immediately.

(TANGO)
The beginning of the assault worked like clockwork,
not one gear was out of place.  However, things
started to unravel quickly once the hostages were
taken.  The yacht is unusable because of mechanical
problems, eliminating the best and only route of
escape.  It is unknown how the Guardia Civil reacted
to this situation so quickly, just dumb luck
probably, but that must be investigated in the
future.  The Guardia Civil has formed a perimeter
both on the land and in the inlet; we are trapped
for the time being.  We must keep the hostages
alive, they are our only bargaining chip, and if
they die so do we.

It is unlikely that the Spanish government will risk
the lives of the hostages with an assault at this
time.  We must use this time to bunker down and
prepare for a possible attack later in the day.
Exploit every opportunity for a peaceful and
favorable resolution to this situation.  Try to stay
alive; you are no use to the cause dead.
