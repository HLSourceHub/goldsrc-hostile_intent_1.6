// MISSION

Time:           1735 ZULU
Location:       Baghdad, Iraq

// SITUATION

Two M2A2 Bradleys have been separated from a convoy 
and ambushed on Al Jami'ah Street, near the 
University of Baghdad.  Their crews are trapped 
inside, and are waiting for help.  While relatively 
safe from small arms fire, the Bradleys are sitting 
ducks.  A tactical unit has been deployed on short 
notice to defend the equipment and crews against 
insurgent forces until further reinforcements arrive.

// BACKGROUND

The fires of open rebellion have erupted in Baghdad,
shortly after a second attempted VX gas attack was
quelled.  The rebellious forces are becoming more
and more daring in their attacks, taking to fighting
in the streets of Baghdad.  It is believed that
ex-Republican Guard forces who had initially thought
to have been eliminated are leading small groups of
insurgents to disrupt the proceedings of the new
government.  NATO forces have been asked to assist
in this resurgence of fighting.
