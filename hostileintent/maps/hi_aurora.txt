// MISSION

Time:           0115 
Location:       British-Columbia, Canada

// SITUATION

Olympic security officials received confirmation
of sarin gas containers configured to disperse
during the opening ceremony of the 2010 Winter
Olympic Games in the greater Vancouver area.
Intelligence sources indicate that this attack
will be launched via personal computer from the 
safety of a rented vacation home deep in the
Rocky Mountains outside of town. The Canadian
government has requested NATO’s assistance in
raiding the home, disabling the computer
dispersal system, and gathering documents
regarding the locations of all the dispensers
so that EOD can neutralize the threat. 

// BACKGROUND

Sarin is an extremely toxic substance that
disrupts the nervous system, overstimulating
muscles and vital organs. It can be inhaled as
a gas or absorbed through the skin. In high
doses, sarin suffocates its victims by paralyzing 
the muscles around their lungs. One hundred
milligrams of sarin—about one drop—can kill the
average person in a few minutes if he or she is
not given an antidote. Experts say sarin is more
than 500 times as toxic as cyanide. It was used
in 1995 by Aum Shinrikyo, a Japanese doomsday 
cult, in a terrorist attack on the Tokyo subway
system that killed 12 and sent more than 5,000
people to hospitals.
