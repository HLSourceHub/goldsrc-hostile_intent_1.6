// MISSION

Time:           1714 ZULU
Location:       Los Angeles, USA

// SITUATION

According to recently discovered documents,
found in eastern Europe after a raid, a major
criminal organization is smuggling drugs,
firearms and munitions into the United States
via one of the country's major importers,
"O'Loughlin And Sons". However, the organization
became aware it was threatened and began shifting
operations to other companies. SWAT units
immediately set up a perimeter around one of the
prime sites, hoping to find intel suggesting the
organization's next move. Shots were fired at SWAT
snipers attempting to set up on the surrounding
roofs, so a team has been deployed to neutralize
the facility. Those inside should be considered
armed and extremely dangerous.

// BACKGROUND

The criminal organization behind the operations
remains unknown - designated C-13 in official
reports due to rumors that it was formed from an
alliance of 13 crime lords from different
countries across Europe and the Americas.
O'Loughlin & Sons, once a proud family business,
discovered it could make much more money through
illicit trade, and came under the wing of C-13 
during the late 1990's. The organization itself 
has been in operation since the mid or late 1980's,
but only recently have its operations attracted
international notice. Its core profits are derived
from smuggling drugs, armaments, rare animals,
gold, diamonds and alcohol.
