// MISSION

Time:           11:42 ZULU
Location:       100 Miles West of Klina, Kosovo

// SITUATION

Intelligence reports suggest a number of toxic
agents have been moved into the area in preparation
for a terrorist chemical weapons attack on a number 
of central government buildings.

NATO has been called in by the UN to assist in 
recovering the toxic agents and eliminate the threat
before the plans get any further.

The most likely locations for the toxic agents to 
be stored are old barns and storage buildings.
A tip-off has suggested sensitive intel may also
be found in a large headquarters building at the 
edge of the town. This could be valuable 
information in stopping the terrorist group
responsible.

// BACKGROUND

Little is known about the faction which has obtained
the toxic materials. it has been known that some 
"wild terrorist groups" have taken over villages 
throughout Kosovo and are plotting attacks against 
the central government.
