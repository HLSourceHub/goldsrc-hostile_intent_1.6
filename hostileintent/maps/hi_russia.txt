// MISSION

Time:           0240 
Location:       Nefteugansk, Russia

// SITUATION

Intelligence indicates that militant supporters
of the former USSR are gathered in NC-78, a
decommissioned Soviet outpost in the mountains
of Nefteugansk. The militants are organizing
trade and smuggling operations in the region to
unknown buyers interested in the gathering of
illegal weapons and arms. Lists of the buyers
should be in the facility.

// BACKGROUND

The sale of illegal weapons becomes a good way
to make a quick buck in the former Soviet Union.
Military cells throughout the country have
started to operate on their own since Moscow cut
off paychecks for their service in the post-
communist nation. These rogue cells will stop at
nothing, using their prior military training to
provide an income for themselves and their
organization.
