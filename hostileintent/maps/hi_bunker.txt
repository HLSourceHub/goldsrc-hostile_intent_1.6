// MISSION

Time:           0830 
Location:       Near Smolensk, Russia

// SITUATION

Intelligence indicates that militant supporters
of the former USSR are gathered in NC-60, an
abandoned Soviet bunker complex in the mountains
of Smolensk.

This intelligence was obtained through
the gathering of lists of potential buyers in
NC-78, a decommissioned Soviet outpost in the mountains
of Nefteugansk.

The militants are organizing trade and smuggling
operations in the region to unknown buyers interested
in the gathering of illegal weapons and explosives.
They are using the administrative/shipping and storage
part of NC-60 for their operations. Their full intentions
for these explosives are unknown.

// BACKGROUND

By obtaining the lists in NC-78 and after months of
preparation and oberservation, intelligence was finally able
to track this militant cell down.
It is assumed Cuban customers are present.
