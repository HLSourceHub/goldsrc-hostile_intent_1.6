// MISSION

Time:           2015
Location:       Miami, USA

// SITUATION

Following the discovery of documents after a raid
in eastern Europe which uncovered information on 
a major criminal organization smuggling drugs,
firearms and munitions into the United States
and the subsequent "O'Loughlin And Sons"  SWAT
mission in New York, further information has been
revealed from interrogation of the detained criminals
from the New York incident. Several cases of
high explosive weapons are believed to have been
been transported to a facility in Miami in preparation
for a deal by an as-yet unknown 3rd party. The site
is well guarded and the criminals are armed. A SWAT
tea, has been deployed to secure the weapons and 
eliminate any enemy threat.

// BACKGROUND

The criminal organization behind the operations
remains unknown - designated C-13 in official
reports due to rumors that it was formed from an
alliance of 13 crime lords from different
countries across Europe and the Americas.
O'Loughlin & Sons, once a proud family business,
discovered it could make much more money through
illicit trade, and came under the wing of C-13 
during the late 1990's. The organization itself 
has been in operation since the mid or late 1980's,
but only recently have its operations attracted
international notice. Its core profits are derived
from smuggling drugs, armaments, rare animals,
gold, diamonds and alcohol.
